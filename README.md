# Hangman
## Introduction
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that has been around for generations. It involves guessing letters of an unknown word or phrase, one letter at a time, until the entire word is revealed or a certain number of incorrect guesses are made.
## NO GUI
This project is an implementation of the Hangman game in Python, without a graphical user interface (GUI). The game is played entirely in the terminal, where the user enters letters to guess the hidden word. The game also features a limited number of guesses before the player loses the game.
## Implementation
The game is implemented using Python's built-in functions and control structures, including loops, conditionals, and string manipulation. It features randomly generated words from a pre-defined list.
## Benifit Of Playing it
The Hangman game is a fun and educational way to improve vocabulary and spelling skills, and can be enjoyed by all age groups. This implementation provides a simple and interactive way to play the game, and can be used as a starting point for more complex versions or GUI implementations.
